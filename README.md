# skolariscloud3

A language-agnostic VS Code workspace scaffold. Includes sensible defaults, recommended extensions, and a minimal CI workflow.

## Structure

- `src/` – your application code
- `tests/` – tests
- `docs/` – documentation and notes
- `.vscode/` – editor settings, tasks, recommendations
- `.github/` – GitHub workflows and project guidance

## Getting started

1. Put code in `src/` and tests in `tests/`.
2. Update LICENSE and README as needed.
3. Optional tasks: use "Format: Prettier" and "Lint: ESLint" from the Tasks panel if you add Node/JS tooling.

## Notes

This repo is framework-neutral and ready to add PHP/JS/Python tooling as needed.
