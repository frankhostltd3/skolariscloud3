## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `resources/views/tenant/student/notes/create.blade.php`: Complete overhaul of the creation view.
- `resources/views/tenant/student/notes/edit.blade.php`: Complete overhaul of the editing view.

### Dependencies
- **Summernote:** Loaded via CDN (`summernote-lite.min.css`, `summernote-lite.min.js`).
- **Bootstrap 5:** Utilizes the existing project's Bootstrap framework.
- **jQuery:** Required by Summernote (assumed to be present or loaded via CDN if needed).

### Controller Compatibility
The existing `NotesController` (`app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/Student/NotesController.php`) was verified to be fully compatible with these changes:
- `content` field stores the HTML generated by Summernote.
- `color` field validation supports the new hex color codes.
- `tags` processing logic remains unchanged.

## Usage Guide

1.  **Creating a Note:** Navigate to **Notes > Create Note**.
2.  **Using the Research Assistant:** Click the **"AI Research Assistant"** button in the top right to open the side panel.
3.  **Inserting Research:** Search for a topic in the Wikipedia tab and click a result title to insert it into your note.
4.  **Formatting:** Use the toolbar at the top of the editor to format text, add tables, or insert images.
5.  **Sharing:** Click the **Share** icon (arrow) in the toolbar to share via Email, WhatsApp, or Twitter.
6.  **Saving:** Click **Save** to store your note.

## Future Improvements
- **Server-side Image Upload:** Currently, images in Summernote are base64 encoded. For production scaling, implementing a dedicated image upload handler would be beneficial.
- **Collaborative Editing:** Real-time collaboration using WebSockets.
- **PDF Export:** Generate a PDF version of the note for offline use.
